  ------------------------

For everyone else, if you'd like to use it or run it yourself, that's fine by me.

First, clone the repository.  Then, run `npm install`.
To run the app, run `npm start`.
To build, run `npm run build`.

Currently missing: Possible Update functionality?  Would need to include textareas that have the store.desc as the default value or something.  Should match everything needed for the project.

Planned: Update Functionality, css fixes.  Do we really need a live site?
