# Daniel-Bookmarks-App

Repository: https://github.com/thinkful-ei-narwhal/daniel-bookmarks-app

Live Site:

Currently missing: Possible Update functionality?  Would need to include textareas that have the store.desc as the default value or something.  Should match everything needed for the project.

Planned: Update Functionality, css fixes.  Do we really need a live site?
